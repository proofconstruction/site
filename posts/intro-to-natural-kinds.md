### The Idea

Various forms of realist hold that things, loosely construed, exist independently of people and their perception of those things. Usually, these things are grouped together in some way, to facilitate analysis by reference to the collection.

Some collections, it is hoped, are _natural_, in the sense that they are described by some property or properties that determine those collections uniquely and absolutely, and where no such property is the self-referential class-membership property. In other words:

- the collection $K_P$ contains all things $x$ such that property $P$ holds of $x$,
- there is no $y$ in $K_P$ for which $P$ does not hold, and
- $K_P$ cannot be given by $P = \text{"is a member of $K_P$"}$.

The extension to the case where $K$ is determined by a family of properties is straightforward.

Under this reasoning, the class of all humans would be a natural kind, because presumably there is a property or set of properties that humans have and nothing else non-human has. By contrast, the class containing a single human - say, the author - the color red, and a random integer, would not constitute a natural class, because there are properties shared by these elements that are not exclusive to them, and because each has at least one property that does not hold of the others.

### Where I'm Going

I'm not committed to metaphysical realism, or indeed most philosophical theses, but I found the basic premise approachable: collections of objects fully determined by one or more properties are abundant in mathematics, and tools from that field should find ready application here. In particular, if we relax the uniqueness property at least to uniqueness-up-to-isomorphism, we have (the object collections of) categories.

For example, in the category of groups $Grp$, all and only algebraic groups are present in the object class $Ob(Grp)$, and every $G$ in $Ob(Grp)$ satisfies a family of properties called the [group axioms](https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Definition:Group_Axioms).

Various structural approaches to natural kinds exist, which try to characterize what it means to be such a kind using formal tools rather than a natural-language analysis. My current work is translating these faithfully into the language of categories, and from there building connections to situate the theory of natural kinds within the broader mathematical landscape.
